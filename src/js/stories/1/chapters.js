const chp_1 = `It was the most tiresome kite in the world, always wagging its tail, shaking its ears, breaking its string, sitting down on the tops of houses, getting stuck in trees, flopping down on ponds, or lying flat on the grass, and refusing to rise higher than a yard from the ground.`;

const chp_2 = `I have often sat and thought about that kite, and wondered who its father and mother were. Perhaps they were very poor people, just made of newspaper and little bits of common string knotted together, obliged to fly day and night for a living, and never able to give any time to their children or to bring them up properly. `;

const chp_3 = `It was pretty, for it had a snow-white face, and a delicate tail with bows; and, with these, no one, let alone a kite, could help being pretty.`;

const chp_4 = `
But though the kite was pretty, it was not good, and it did not prosper; it came to a bad end, oh! a terrible end
indeed. It stuck itself on a roof one day, a common red roof with a grey chimney. 
It stuck itself there, and it would not move; the children tugged and pulled and coaxed and cried, 
but still it would not move.
`;

const chp_5 = `At last they fetched a ladder, and had nearly reached it when suddenly the kite started and flew away—right away over the field and over the heath, and over the far far woods, and it never came back again—never—never.`;

const chp_6 = `Dear, that is all. But I think sometimes that perhaps beyond the dark pines and the roaring sea the kite is flying still, on and on, farther and farther away, for ever and for ever.`;
